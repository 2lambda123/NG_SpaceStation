# Space  station game  
  
Main idea of the game was bring up to students ability to test their skills, and speed up C++ learning. Every student from NewGeneration flow can freely fork and commit this repo, and implement anything you only want!  
By *anything* I mean literally *anything* but fitting to space theme.  
  
## Game rules  
  
You spawn at broken space station, which in a pretty bad situation: no working power source, broken oxygen deployment subsystem, and station AI is breaking bad. Also, don't forget that you are not alone: your friends also can join your round and help in fixing... or create the hell on station by destroing it.  
  
## How to build game  
  
To build game you need Qt version 5.15. And that's all: just build **Server** and **Client** project.  
  
## How to start game  
  
In order to start game, just move all `gameConfigs` folder contents to your build-folders for client and server.  
That's all, now you ready to start game :3
